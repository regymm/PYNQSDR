PYNQ-Z1 + AD936X SDR platform and more. Openwifi & PlutoSDR capable.

This project demonstrated that AD936X chip can combine with low-cost ZYNQ FPGA development boards, especially PYNQ-Z1, and run openwifi without problem. This can potentially become an extremely low-cost openwifi platform. And with extensions removed, you still have a PYNQ capable of any other serious ZYNQ projects. 

Going beyond PYNQ-Z1, this extension board can also combine with other hardware by easy 2-layer conversion board and provide even lower-cost platforms.
